# Capstone Project - Sparkify
This is the repository for the final project of the Udacity Data Scientist for Enterprise NanoDegree.

### Description
In this project we use the PySpark SQL and MLlib libraries to go through the entire data science process to predict churn of users for a fictional music streaming service called 'Sparkify'.
The full blog post explaining the process and results achieved is accessible here


### Data
The full dataset is 12GB, of which we analyze a mini subset (126MB).
The data consists of logs of users interactions with the Sparkify service in json format.

### Required Packages
- PySpark
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

### Repository Content
- sparkify.html: html export of the jupyter notebook
- sparkify.ipynb: jupyter notebook with all the steps from data exploration & preparation to modeling & evaluation
- mini_sparkify_event_data.zip: zip of the json data for the subset of data
