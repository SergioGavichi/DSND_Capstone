# Capstone Project - Sparkify
This is the repository for the final project of the Udacity Data Scientist for Enterprise NanoDegree.

### Description
In this project we use the PySpark SQL and MLlib libraries to go through the entire data science process to predict churn of users for a fictional music streaming service called 'Sparkify'.
The full blog post explaining the process and results achieved is accessible here
